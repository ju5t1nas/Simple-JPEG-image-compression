# Simple-JPEG-image-compression
I store my attempt at simple JPEG image compression. This folder contains two versions of the compression and some pictures to try them out.

There are two different versions of comrepssion. First for monochrome images, and the second for colour pictures.
The idea behind the compression is to take and average of four pixel colour values and replace them with a single pixel.
